## Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing situational awareness for individuals, specifically police officers, operating in high-risk, low-time scenarios. We are developing a mobile application designed as a training tool to help officers recognize physiological stress indicators, manage their responses, and ultimately improve their decision-making under pressure.

## Project Goal
By the end of this project (Spring 2025), we aim to deliver an application that serves as a **practical, accessible, and cost-effective alternative or supplement** to current situational awareness and stress management training tools, many of which are beyond the reach of smaller police departments. The ultimate goal is to help circumvent tragedies linked to impaired decision-making within the police force.
