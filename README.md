## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing situational awareness for individuals, specifically police officers, operating in high-risk, low-time scenarios. We are developing a mobile application designed as a training tool to help officers recognize physiological stress indicators, manage their responses, and ultimately improve their decision-making under pressure.

## The Problem

Tragic events often occur due to misjudgments made in high-stress situations where time is limited. Whether it's a paramedic making a critical medical decision or a police officer facing a potential threat, a decline in situational awareness significantly impairs decision-making capabilities.

Despite recognizing this correlation, there remains a gap in readily available and effective tools specifically designed to bolster situational awareness during these critical moments. The continued absence of such tools risks further preventable tragedies.

## Our Solution

While the ideal solution would address numerous high-risk scenarios, this project specifically targets enhancing the situational awareness of police officers. We propose an application that trains officers to identify when they are most vulnerable to decision-making errors.

Our approach leverages the link between elevated heart rates and the potential for clouded judgment under stress. The application will:

1.  **Monitor Heart Rate:** Utilize heart rate monitors during training exercises.
2.  **Simulate Scenarios:** Incorporate accredited marksmanship tools and relevant training scenarios.
3.  **Provide Feedback:** Offer insights to users about their physiological responses during simulated high-stress events.
4.  **Train Stress Management:** Enable officers to practice recognizing and controlling stress responses that could impair judgment.

The application aims to be user-friendly, allowing officers to effectively train and improve their tolerance and management of high-risk situations.

## Project Goal

By the end of this project (Spring 2025), we aim to deliver an application that serves as a **practical, accessible, and cost-effective alternative or supplement** to current situational awareness and stress management training tools, many of which are beyond the reach of smaller police departments. The ultimate goal is to help circumvent tragedies linked to impaired decision-making within the police force.
